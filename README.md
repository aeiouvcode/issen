## About

ISSEN is a third-person duel rendered as a living ink painting. Figures are brushed onto a paper ground, strikes leave slash arcs, and a dodge leaves a ghost behind. The boss changes pattern at half health and some of his strikes are feints: a real strike always shows a ring on the ground first.

## Controls

| Action | Keyboard / mouse | Touch |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Move | WASD | Left thumb |
| Camera | Drag | Right side of screen |
| Strike | Click or J | 斬 |
| Dodge | Space or Shift | 避 |
| Heal (4 charges) | F | 気 |

A last-breath dodge reads the incoming strike. The brush setting on the title screen switches ink density.
